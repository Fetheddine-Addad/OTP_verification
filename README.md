# OTP Verification using Python and customtkinter

**Explanation:**

This project demonstrates how to implement a basic OTP (One-Time Password) verification system using Python and the `customtkinter` library for GUI creation. While this example focuses on the frontend using `customtkinter`, **it's important to note that the actual sending of the OTP is not implemented within this code**. You'll need to integrate a separate method for sending the OTP, such as using the `smtplib` library in Python or an external service like an SMS API.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3 (download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* `customtkinter` library (install using `pip install customtkinter`)
